# EncryptyDecrypty
 Welcome To a python script that will encrypt and decrypt files.

 You must intall cryptography for this to work.

 Tried compileing it but Windows thinks it is malware! So for now you cryptography must be installed.
 
 Also you cannot encrypt then decrypt the same file in the same session you must restart the script.

 Have fun.
